// NOTE: console.log prints text to the browser console that you can enable
//       to see the output. It is a little bit more convenient than alert so
//       we will use it most of the time.

// 1. Study the following sequence: 1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 15, 14, 42, ...
//    Create an array with the first 25 elements of this sequence.
//    Obviously this has to be done programmatically.

// 1. Add 9 and 10 to the end of the array. Make sure you keep the order.

console.log(arr);
// 2. Add 0 and 1 to the beginning of the array. Make sure you keep the order.

// Removing elements //
